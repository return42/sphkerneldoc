-  ``Documentation/locking/spinlocks.txt``: Linus Torvalds' spinlocking tutorial in the kernel sources.

-  Unix Systems for Modern Architectures: Symmetric Multiprocessing and Caching for Kernel Programmers:

   Curt Schimmel's very good introduction to kernel level locking (not written for Linux, but nearly everything applies). The book is expensive, but really worth every penny to
   understand SMP locking. [ISBN: 0201633388]
