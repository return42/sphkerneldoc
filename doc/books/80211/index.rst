    These books attempt to give a description of the various subsystems
    that play a role in 802.11 wireless networking in Linux. Since these
    books are for kernel developers they attempts to document the
    structures and functions used in the kernel as well as giving a
    higher-level overview.

    The reader is expected to be familiar with the 802.11 standard as
    published by the IEEE in 802.11-2007 (or possibly later versions).
    References to this standard will be given as "802.11-2007 8.1.5".
