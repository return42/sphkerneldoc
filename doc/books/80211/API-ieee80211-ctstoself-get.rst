CTS-to-self frame generation function


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: void ieee80211_ctstoself_get( struct ieee80211_hw * hw, struct ieee80211_vif * vif, const void * frame, size_t frame_len, const struct ieee80211_tx_info * frame_txctl, struct ieee80211_cts * cts )

Arguments
=========

``hw``
    pointer obtained from ``ieee80211_alloc_hw``.

``vif``
    ``struct ieee80211_vif`` pointer from the add_interface callback.

``frame``
    pointer to the frame that is going to be protected by the CTS-to-self.

``frame_len``
    the frame length (in octets).

``frame_txctl``
    ``struct ieee80211_tx_info`` of the frame.

``cts``
    The buffer where to store the CTS-to-self frame.


Description
===========

If the CTS-to-self frames are generated by the host system (i.e., not in hardware/firmware), the low-level driver uses this function to receive the next CTS-to-self frame from the
802.11 code. The low-level is responsible for calling this function before and CTS-to-self frame is needed.
