Description
===========

Obtain an IS_ROOT dentry for the root of a filesystem.

We must ensure that directory inodes only ever have one dentry. If a dentry is found, that is returned instead of allocating a new one.

On successful return, the reference to the inode has been transferred to the dentry. In case of an error the reference on the inode is released. A ``NULL`` or IS_ERR inode may be
passed in and will be the error will be propagate to the return value, with a ``NULL`` ``inode`` replaced by ERR_PTR(-ESTALE).
