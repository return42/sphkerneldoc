===========

*man freeze_bdev(9)*

*4.6.0-rc1*

- lock a filesystem and force it into a consistent state


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct super_block â‹† freeze_bdev( struct block_device * bdev )

Arguments
=========

``bdev``
    blockdevice to lock


Description
===========

If a superblock is found on this device, we take the s_umount semaphore on it to make sure nobody unmounts until the snapshot creation is done. The reference counter
(bd_fsfreeze_count) guarantees that only the last unfreeze process can unfreeze the frozen filesystem actually when multiple freeze requests arrive simultaneously. It counts up
in ``freeze_bdev`` and count down in ``thaw_bdev``. When it becomes 0, ``thaw_bdev`` will unfreeze actually.
