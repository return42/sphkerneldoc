===========

Allocates a new inode for given superblock. The default gfp_mask for allocations related to inode->i_mapping is GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE. If HIGHMEM pages are unsuitable or it is
known that pages allocated for the page cache are not reclaimable or migratable, ``mapping_set_gfp_mask`` must be called with suitable flags on the newly created inode's mapping
