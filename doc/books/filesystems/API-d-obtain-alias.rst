find or allocate a DISCONNECTED dentry for a given inode


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct dentry * d_obtain_alias( struct inode * inode )

Arguments
=========

``inode``
    inode to allocate the dentry for


Description
===========

Obtain a dentry for an inode resulting from NFS filehandle conversion or
similar open by handle operations. The returned dentry may be anonymous,
or may have a full name (if the inode was already in the cache).

When called on a directory inode, we must ensure that the inode only
ever has one dentry. If a dentry is found, that is returned instead of
allocating a new one.

On successful return, the reference to the inode has been transferred to
the dentry. In case of an error the reference on the inode is released.
To make it easier to use in export operations a ``NULL`` or IS_ERR
inode may be passed in and the error will be propagated to the return
value, with a ``NULL`` ``inode`` replaced by ERR_PTR(-ESTALE).
