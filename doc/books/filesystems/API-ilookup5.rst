*man ilookup5(9)*

*4.6.0-rc1*

search for an inode in the inode cache


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct inode â‹† ilookup5( struct super_block * sb, unsigned long hashval, int (*test) struct inode *, void *, void * data )

Arguments
=========

``sb``
    super block of file system to search

``hashval``
    hash value (usually inode number) to search for

``test``
    callback used for comparisons between inodes

``data``
    opaque data pointer to pass to ``test``


Description
===========

Search for the inode specified by ``hashval`` and ``data`` in the inode cache, and if the inode is in the cache, return the inode with an incremented reference count. Waits on
I_NEW before returning the inode. returned with an incremented reference count.

This is a generalized version of ``ilookup`` for file systems where the inode number is not sufficient for unique identification of an inode.


Note
====

``test`` is called with the inode_hash_lock held, so can't sleep.
