===========
iget_locked
===========

*man iget_locked(9)*

*4.6.0-rc1*

obtain an inode from a mounted file system


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct inode â‹† iget_locked( struct super_block * sb, unsigned long ino )

Arguments
=========

``sb``
    super block of file system

``ino``
    inode number to get


Description
===========

Search for the inode specified by ``ino`` in the inode cache and if present return it with an increased reference count. This is for file systems where the inode number is
sufficient for unique identification of an inode.

If the inode is not in cache, allocate a new inode and return it locked, hashed, and with the I_NEW flag set. The file system gets to fill it in before unlocking it via
``unlock_new_inode``.
