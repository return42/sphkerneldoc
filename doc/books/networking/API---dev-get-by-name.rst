find a device by its name


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct net_device â‹† __dev_get_by_name( struct net * net, const char * name )

Arguments
=========

``net``
    the applicable net namespace

``name``
    name to find


Description
===========

Find an interface by name. Must be called under RTNL semaphore or ``dev_base_lock``. If the name is found a pointer to the device is returned. If the name is not found then
``NULL`` is returned. The reference counters are not incremented so the caller must be careful with locks.
