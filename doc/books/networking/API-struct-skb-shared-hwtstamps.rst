hwtstamp
    hardware time stamp transformed into duration since arbitrary point in time


Description
===========

Software time stamps generated by ``ktime_get_real`` are stored in skb->tstamp.

hwtstamps can only be compared against other hwtstamps from the same device.

This structure is attached to packets as part of the ``skb_shared_info``. Use ``skb_hwtstamps`` to get a pointer.
