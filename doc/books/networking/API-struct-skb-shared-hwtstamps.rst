hwtstamp
    hardware time stamp transformed into duration since arbitrary point
    in time


Description
===========

Software time stamps generated by ``ktime_get_real`` are stored in
skb->tstamp.

hwtstamps can only be compared against other hwtstamps from the same
device.

This structure is attached to packets as part of the
``skb_shared_info``. Use ``skb_hwtstamps`` to get a pointer.
