=============

*man sockfd_lookup(9)*

*4.6.0-rc1*

Go from a file number to its socket slot


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct socket â‹† sockfd_lookup( int fd, int * err )

Arguments
=========

``fd``
    file handle

``err``
    pointer to an error code return


Description
===========

The file handle passed in is locked and the socket it is bound too is returned. If an error occurs the err pointer is overwritten with a negative errno code and NULL is returned.
The function checks for both invalid handles and passing a handle which is not a socket.

On a success the socket object pointer is returned.
