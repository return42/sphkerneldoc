make a copy of a shared buffer


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct sk_buff â‹† skb_unshare( struct sk_buff * skb, gfp_t pri )

Arguments
=========

``skb``
    buffer to check

``pri``
    priority for memory allocation


Description
===========

If the socket buffer is a clone then this function creates a new copy of the data, drops a reference count on the old copy and returns the new copy with the reference count at 1.
If the buffer is not a clone the original buffer is returned. When called with a spinlock held or from interrupt state ``pri`` must be ``GFP_ATOMIC``

``NULL`` is returned on a memory allocation failure.
