.. c:function:: struct net_device â‹† dev_get_by_name( struct net * net, const char * name )

Arguments
=========

``net``
    the applicable net namespace

``name``
    name to find


Description
===========

release it when it is no longer needed. ``NULL`` is returned if no matching device is found.
