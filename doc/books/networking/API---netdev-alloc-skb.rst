==================
__netdev_alloc_skb
==================

*man __netdev_alloc_skb(9)*

*4.6.0-rc1*

allocate an skbuff for rx on a specific device


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct sk_buff â‹† __netdev_alloc_skb( struct net_device * dev, unsigned int len, gfp_t gfp_mask )

Arguments
=========

``dev``
    network device to receive on

``len``
    length to allocate

``gfp_mask``
    get_free_pages mask, passed to alloc_skb


Description
===========

Allocate a new ``sk_buff`` and assign it a usage count of one. The buffer has NET_SKB_PAD headroom built in. Users should allocate the headroom they think they need without
accounting for the built in space. The built in space is used for optimisations.

``NULL`` is returned if there is no free memory.
