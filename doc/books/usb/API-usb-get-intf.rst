usb_get_intf
============

*man usb_get_intf(9)*

*4.6.0-rc1*

increments the reference count of the usb interface structure


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct usb_interface â‹† usb_get_intf( struct usb_interface * intf )

Arguments
=========

``intf``
    the interface being referenced


Description
===========

Each live reference to a interface must be refcounted.

Drivers for USB interfaces should normally record such references in their ``probe`` methods, when they bind to an interface, and release them by calling ``usb_put_intf``, in their
``disconnect`` methods.


Return
======

A pointer to the interface with the incremented reference counter.
