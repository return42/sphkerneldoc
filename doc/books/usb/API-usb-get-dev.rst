Synopsis

.. c:function:: struct usb_device â‹† usb_get_dev( struct usb_device * dev )

Arguments

Description

Each live reference to a device should be refcounted.

Drivers for USB interfaces should normally record such references in their ``probe`` methods, when they bind to an interface, and release them by calling ``usb_put_dev``, in their
``disconnect`` methods.

A pointer to the device with the incremented reference counter.
