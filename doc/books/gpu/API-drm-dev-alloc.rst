*4.6.0-rc1*

Allocate new DRM device


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct drm_device â‹† drm_dev_alloc( struct drm_driver * driver, struct device * parent )

Arguments
=========

``driver``
    DRM driver to allocate device for

``parent``
    Parent device object


Description
===========

Allocate and initialize a new DRM device. No device registration is done. Call ``drm_dev_register`` to advertice the device to user space and register it with other core
subsystems. This should be done last in the device initialization sequence to make sure userspace can't access an inconsistent state.

The initial ref-count of the object is 1. Use ``drm_dev_ref`` and ``drm_dev_unref`` to take and drop further ref-counts.

Note that for purely virtual devices ``parent`` can be NULL.


RETURNS
=======

Pointer to new DRM device, or NULL if out of memory.
