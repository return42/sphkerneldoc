drm_mode_object_find
====================

*man drm_mode_object_find(9)*

*4.6.0-rc1*

look up a drm object with static lifetime


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct drm_mode_object â‹† drm_mode_object_find( struct drm_device * dev, uint32_t id, uint32_t type )

Arguments
=========

``dev``
    drm device

``id``
    id of the mode object

``type``
    type of the mode object


Description
===========

Note that framebuffers cannot be looked up with this functions - since those are reference counted, they need special treatment. Even with DRM_MODE_OBJECT_ANY (although that
will simply return NULL rather than ``WARN_ON``).
