Thanks to Andi Kleen for the idea, answering my questions, fixing my
mistakes, filling content, etc. Philipp Rumpf for more spelling and
clarity fixes, and some excellent non-obvious points. Werner Almesberger
for giving me a great summary of ``disable_irq()``, and Jes Sorensen and
Andrea Arcangeli added caveats. Michael Elizabeth Chastain for checking
and adding to the Configure section. Telsa Gwynne for teaching me
DocBook.
