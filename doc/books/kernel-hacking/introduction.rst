Introduction

Welcome, gentle reader, to Rusty's Remarkably Unreliable Guide to Linux Kernel Hacking. This document describes the common routines and general requirements for kernel code: its
goal is to serve as a primer for Linux kernel development for experienced C programmers. I avoid implementation details: that's what the code is for, and I ignore whole tracts of
useful routines.

Before you read this, please understand that I never wanted to write this document, being grossly under-qualified, but I always wanted to read it, and this was the only way. I hope
it will grow into a compendium of best practice, common starting points and random information.
