Introduction

RapidIO is a high speed switched fabric interconnect with features aimed at the embedded market. RapidIO provides support for memory-mapped I/O as well as message-based
transactions over the switched fabric network. RapidIO has a standardized discovery mechanism not unlike the PCI bus standard that allows simple detection of devices in a network.

This documentation is provided for developers intending to support RapidIO on new architectures, write new drivers, or to understand the subsystem internals.
