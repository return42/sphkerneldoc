Members

setkey
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

setauthsize
    Set authentication size for the AEAD transformation. This function is used to specify the consumer requested size of the authentication tag to be either generated by the
    transformation during encryption or the size of the authentication tag to be supplied during the decryption operation. This function is also responsible for checking the
    authentication tag size for validity.

encrypt
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

decrypt
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

init
    Initialize the cryptographic transformation object. This function is used to initialize the cryptographic transformation object. This function is called only once at the
    instantiation time, right after the transformation context was allocated. In case the cryptographic hardware has some special requirements which need to be handled by software,
    this function shall check for the precise requirement of the transformation and put any software fallbacks in place.

exit
    Deinitialize the cryptographic transformation object. This is a counterpart to ``init``, used to remove various changes set in ``init``.

geniv
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

ivsize
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

maxauthsize
    Set the maximum authentication tag size supported by the transformation. A transformation may support smaller tag sizes. As the authentication tag is a message digest to ensure
    the integrity of the encrypted data, a consumer typically wants the largest authentication tag possible as defined by this variable.

base
    Definition of a generic crypto cipher algorithm.


Description
===========

All fields except ``ivsize`` is mandatory and must be filled.
