Thanks

The bulk of the ATA knowledge comes thanks to long conversations with Andre Hedrick (www.linux-ide.org), and long hours pondering the ATA and SCSI specifications.

Thanks to Alan Cox for pointing out similarities between SATA and SCSI, and in general for motivation to hack on libata.

libata's device detection method, ata_pio_devchk, and in general all the early probing was based on extensive study of Hale Landis's probe/reset code in his ATADRVR driver
(www.ata-atapi.com).
