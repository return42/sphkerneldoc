-  drivers/iio/
   , contains the IIO core plus and directories for each sensor type (e.g. accel, magnetometer, etc.)
-  include/linux/iio/
   , contains the header files, nice to read for the internal kernel interfaces.
-  include/uapi/linux/iio/
   , contains files to be used by user space applications.
-  tools/iio/
   , contains tools for rapidly testing buffers, events and device creation.
-  drivers/staging/iio/
   , contains code for some drivers or experimental features that are not yet mature enough to be moved out.

Besides the code, there are some good online documentation sources:

-  Industrial I/O mailing list
-  Analog Device IIO wiki page
-  Using the Linux IIO framework for SDR, Lars-Peter Clausen's presentation at FOSDEM
