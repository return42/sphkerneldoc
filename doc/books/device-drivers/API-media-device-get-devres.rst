get media device as device resource creates if one doesn't exist


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct media_device â‹† media_device_get_devres( struct device * dev )

Arguments
=========

``dev``
    pointer to struct ``device``.


Description
===========

Sometimes, the media controller ``media_device`` needs to be shared by more than one driver. This function adds support for that, by dynamically allocating the ``media_device`` and
allowing it to be obtained from the struct ``device`` associated with the common device where all sub-device components belong. So, for example, on an USB device with multiple
interfaces, each interface may be handled by a separate per-interface drivers. While each interface have its own ``device``, they all share a common ``device`` associated with the
hole USB device.
