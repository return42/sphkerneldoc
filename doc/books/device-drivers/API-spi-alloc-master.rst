allocate SPI master controller


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct spi_master â‹† spi_alloc_master( struct device * dev, unsigned size )

Arguments
=========

``dev``
    the controller, possibly using the platform_bus

``size``
    how much zeroed driver-private data to allocate; the pointer to this memory is in the driver_data field of the returned device, accessible with ``spi_master_get_devdata``.


Context
=======

can sleep


Description
===========

This call is used only by SPI master controller drivers, which are the only ones directly touching chip registers. It's how they allocate an spi_master structure, prior to calling
``spi_register_master``.

This must be called from context that can sleep.

The caller is responsible for assigning the bus number and initializing the master's methods before calling ``spi_register_master``; and (after errors adding the device) calling
``spi_master_put`` to prevent a memory leak.


Return
======

the SPI master structure on success, else NULL.
