==================
driver_find_device
==================

*man driver_find_device(9)*

*4.6.0-rc1*

device iterator for locating a particular device.


Synopsis
========

.. c:function:: struct device â‹† driver_find_device( struct device_driver * drv, struct device * start, void * data, int (*match) struct device *dev, void *data )

Arguments
=========

``drv``
    The device's driver

``start``
    Device to begin with

``data``
    Data to pass to match function

``match``
    Callback function to check device


Description
===========

This is similar to the ``driver_for_each_device`` function above, but it returns a reference to a device that is 'found' for later use, as determined by the ``match`` callback.

The callback should return 0 if the device doesn't match and non-zero if it does. If the callback returns non-zero, this function will return to the caller and not iterate over any
more devices.
