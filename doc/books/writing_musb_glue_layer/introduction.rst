Introduction

The Linux MUSB subsystem is part of the larger Linux USB subsystem. It provides support for embedded USB Device Controllers (UDC) that do not use Universal Host Controller
Interface (UHCI) or Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI).

Instead, these embedded UDC rely on the USB On-the-Go (OTG) specification which they implement at least partially. The silicon reference design used in most cases is the Multipoint
USB Highspeed Dual-Role Controller (MUSB HDRC) found in the Mentor Graphics Inventraâ„¢ design.

As a self-taught exercise I have written an MUSB glue layer for the Ingenic JZ4740 SoC, modelled after the many MUSB glue layers in the kernel source tree. This layer can be found
at drivers/usb/musb/jz4740.c. In this documentation I will walk through the basics of the jz4740.c glue layer, explaining the different pieces and what needs to be done in order to
write your own device glue layer.
