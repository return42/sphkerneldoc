/**
 * DOC: buffer object tiling
 *
 * i915_gem_set_tiling() and i915_gem_get_tiling() is the userspace interface to
 * declare fence register requirements.
 *
 * In principle GEM doesn't care at all about the internal data layout of an
 * object, and hence it also doesn't care about tiling or swizzling. There's two
 * exceptions:
 *
 * - For X and Y tiling the hardware provides detilers for CPU access, so called
 *   fences. Since there's only a limited amount of them the kernel must manage
 *   these, and therefore userspace must tell the kernel the object tiling if it
 *   wants to use fences for detiling.
 * - On gen3 and gen4 platforms have a swizzling pattern for tiled objects which
 *   depends upon the physical page frame number. When swapping such objects the
 *   page frame number might change and the kernel must be able to fix this up
 *   and hence now the tiling. Note that on a subset of platforms with
 *   asymmetric memory channel population the swizzling pattern changes in an
 *   unknown way, and for those the kernel simply forbids swapping completely.
 *
 * Since neither of this applies for new tiling layouts on modern platforms like
 * W, Ys and Yf tiling GEM only allows object tiling to be set to X or Y tiled.
 * Anything else can be handled in userspace entirely without the kernel's
 * invovlement.
