setkey
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

setauthsize
    Set authentication size for the AEAD transformation. This
    function is used to specify the consumer requested size of the
    authentication tag to be either generated by the transformation
    during encryption or the size of the authentication tag to be
    supplied during the decryption operation. This function is also
    responsible for checking the authentication tag size for
    validity.

encrypt
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

decrypt
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

init
    Initialize the cryptographic transformation object. This function
    is used to initialize the cryptographic transformation object.
    This function is called only once at the instantiation time, right
    after the transformation context was allocated. In case the
    cryptographic hardware has some special requirements which need to
    be handled by software, this function shall check for the precise
    requirement of the transformation and put any software fallbacks
    in place.

exit
    Deinitialize the cryptographic transformation object. This is a
    counterpart to \ ``init``\ , used to remove various changes set in
    \ ``init``\ .

geniv
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

ivsize
    see struct ablkcipher_alg

maxauthsize
    Set the maximum authentication tag size supported by the
    transformation. A transformation may support smaller tag sizes.
    As the authentication tag is a message digest to ensure the
    integrity of the encrypted data, a consumer typically wants the
    largest authentication tag possible as defined by this
    variable.

        length of the key in bytes

.. _`crypto_aead_setkey.description`:

Description
-----------

The caller provided key is set for the AEAD referenced by the cipher
handle.

Note, the key length determines the cipher type. Many block ciphers implement
different cipher modes depending on the key size, such as AES-128 vs AES-192
vs. AES-256. When providing a 16 byte key for an AES cipher handle, AES-128
is performed.

    encrypt plaintext

    :param struct aead_request \*req:
        reference to the aead_request handle that holds all information
        needed to perform the cipher operation

.. _`crypto_aead_encrypt.description`:

Description
-----------

Encrypt plaintext data using the aead_request handle. That data structure
and how it is filled with data is discussed with the aead_request\_\*
functions.

IMPORTANT NOTE The encryption operation creates the authentication data /
tag. That data is concatenated with the created ciphertext.
The ciphertext memory size is therefore the given number of
block cipher blocks + the size defined by the
crypto_aead_setauthsize invocation. The caller must ensure
that sufficient memory is available for the ciphertext and
the authentication tag.

.. _`crypto_aead_encrypt.return`:

Return
------

0 if the cipher operation was successful; < 0 if an error occurred

.. _`crypto_aead_decrypt`:

        needed to perform the cipher operation

.. _`crypto_aead_decrypt.description`:

Description
-----------

Decrypt ciphertext data using the aead_request handle. That data structure
and how it is filled with data is discussed with the aead_request\_\*
functions.

IMPORTANT NOTE The caller must concatenate the ciphertext followed by the
authentication data / tag. That authentication data / tag
must have the size defined by the crypto_aead_setauthsize
invocation.

.. _`crypto_aead_decrypt.return`:

Return
------

0 if the cipher operation was successful; -EBADMSG: The AEAD
cipher operation performs the authentication of the data during the
decryption operation. Therefore, the function returns this error if
the authentication of the ciphertext was unsuccessful (i.e. the
integrity of the ciphertext or the associated data was violated);
< 0 if an error occurred.

        memory allocation flag that is handed to kmalloc by the API call.

.. _`aead_request_alloc.description`:

Description
-----------

Allocate the request data structure that must be used with the AEAD
encrypt and decrypt API calls. During the allocation, the provided aead
handle is registered in the request data structure.

.. _`aead_request_alloc.return`:

Return
------

allocated request handle in case of success, or NULL if out of memory

.. _`aead_request_free`:

aead_request_free
=================

.. c:function:: void aead_request_free(struct aead_request *req)

        increase the wait queue beyond the initial maximum size;
        CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP the request processing may sleep

    :param crypto_completion_t compl:
        callback function pointer to be registered with the request handle

    :param void \*data:
        The data pointer refers to memory that is not used by the kernel
        crypto API, but provided to the callback function for it to use. Here,
        the caller can provide a reference to memory the callback function can
        operate on. As the callback function is invoked asynchronously to the
        related functionality, it may need to access data structures of the
        related functionality which can be referenced using this pointer. The
        callback function can access the memory via the "data" field in the
        crypto_async_request data structure provided to the callback function.

.. _`aead_request_set_callback.description`:

Description
-----------

Setting the callback function that is triggered once the cipher operation
completes

The callback function is registered with the aead_request handle and
must comply with the following template

void callback_function(struct crypto_async_request \*req, int error)

.. _`aead_request_set_crypt`:

aead_request_set_crypt
======================

    set data buffers

    :param struct aead_request \*req:
        request handle

    :param struct scatterlist \*src:
        source scatter / gather list

    :param struct scatterlist \*dst:
        destination scatter / gather list

    :param unsigned int cryptlen:
        number of bytes to process from \ ``src``\ 

    :param u8 \*iv:
        IV for the cipher operation which must comply with the IV size defined
        by \ :c:func:`crypto_aead_ivsize`\ 

.. _`aead_request_set_crypt.description`:

Description
-----------

Setting the source data and destination data scatter / gather lists which
hold the associated data concatenated with the plaintext or ciphertext. See
below for the authentication tag.

For encryption, the source is treated as the plaintext and the
destination is the ciphertext. For a decryption operation, the use is
reversed - the source is the ciphertext and the destination is the plaintext.

For both src/dst the layout is associated data, plain/cipher text,
authentication tag.

The content of the AD in the destination buffer after processing
will either be untouched, or it will contain a copy of the AD
from the source buffer.  In order to ensure that it always has
a copy of the AD, the user must copy the AD over either before
or after processing.  Of course this is not relevant if the user
is doing in-place processing where src == dst.

IMPORTANT NOTE AEAD requires an authentication tag (MAC). For decryption,
the caller must concatenate the ciphertext followed by the
authentication tag and provide the entire data stream to the
decryption operation (i.e. the data length used for the
initialization of the scatterlist and the data length for the
decryption operation is identical). For encryption, however,
the authentication tag is created while encrypting the data.
The destination buffer must hold sufficient space for the
ciphertext and the authentication tag while the encryption
invocation must only point to the plaintext data size. The
following code snippet illustrates the memory usage
buffer = kmalloc(ptbuflen + (enc ? authsize : 0));
sg_init_one(\ :c:type:`struct sg <sg>`, buffer, ptbuflen + (enc ? authsize : 0));
aead_request_set_crypt(req, \ :c:type:`struct sg <sg>`, \ :c:type:`struct sg <sg>`, ptbuflen, iv);

.. _`aead_request_set_ad`:

aead_request_set_ad
===================

.. c:function:: void aead_request_set_ad(struct aead_request *req, unsigned int assoclen)

    set associated data information

    :param struct aead_request \*req:
        request handle

    :param unsigned int assoclen:
        number of bytes in associated data

.. _`aead_request_set_ad.description`:
