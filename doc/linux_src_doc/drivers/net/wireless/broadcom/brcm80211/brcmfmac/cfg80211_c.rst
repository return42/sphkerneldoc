================

.. c:function:: struct wireless_dev *brcmf_ap_add_vif(struct wiphy *wiphy, const char *name, u32 *flags, struct vif_params *params)

    create a new AP virtual interface for multiple BSS

    :param struct wiphy \*wiphy:
        wiphy device of new interface.

    :param const char \*name:
        name of the new interface.

    :param u32 \*flags:
        not used.

    :param struct vif_params \*params:
        contains mac address for AP device.

brcmf_setup_ifmodes
===================

.. c:function:: int brcmf_setup_ifmodes(struct wiphy *wiphy, struct brcmf_if *ifp)

    determine interface modes and combinations.

    :param struct wiphy \*wiphy:
        wiphy object.

    :param struct brcmf_if \*ifp:
        interface object needed for feat module api.

Description
-----------

The interface modes and combinations are determined dynamically here
based on firmware functionality.
