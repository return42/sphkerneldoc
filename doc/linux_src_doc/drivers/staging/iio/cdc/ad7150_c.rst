Members
-------

client
    i2c client for this device

current_event
    device always has one type of event enabled.
    This element stores the event code of the current one.

threshold
    thresholds for simple capacitance value events

thresh_sensitivity
    threshold for simple capacitance offset
    from 'average' value.

thresh_timeout
    a timeout, in samples from the moment an
    adaptive threshold event occurs to when the average
    value jumps to current value.

mag_timeout
    a timeout, in sample from the moment an
    adaptive magnitude event occurs to when the average
    value jumps to the current value.

old_state
    store state from previous event, allowing confirmation
    of new condition.

conversion_mode
    the current conversion mode.

state_lock
    ensure consistent state of this structure wrt the
    hardware.
