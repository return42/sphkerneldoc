.. _`ad9834_platform_data.members`:

Members
-------

mclk
    master clock in Hz

freq0
    power up freq0 tuning word in Hz

freq1
    power up freq1 tuning word in Hz

phase0
    power up phase0 value [0..4095] correlates with 0..2PI

phase1
    power up phase1 value [0..4095] correlates with 0..2PI

en_div2
    digital output/2 is passed to the SIGN BIT OUT pin

en_signbit_msb_out
    the MSB (or MSB/2) of the DAC data is connected to the
    SIGN BIT OUT pin. en_div2 controls whether it is the MSB
    or MSB/2 that is output. if en_signbit_msb_out=false,
    the on-board comparator is connected to SIGN BIT OUT
