-  ``Documentation/locking/spinlocks.txt``: Linus Torvalds' spinlocking
   tutorial in the kernel sources.

-  Unix Systems for Modern Architectures: Symmetric Multiprocessing and
   Caching for Kernel Programmers:

   Curt Schimmel's very good introduction to kernel level locking (not
   written for Linux, but nearly everything applies). The book is
   expensive, but really worth every penny to understand SMP locking.
