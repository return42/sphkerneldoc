RapidIO is a high speed switched fabric interconnect with features aimed
at the embedded market. RapidIO provides support for memory-mapped I/O
as well as message-based transactions over the switched fabric network.
RapidIO has a standardized discovery mechanism not unlike the PCI bus
standard that allows simple detection of devices in a network.

This documentation is provided for developers intending to support
RapidIO on new architectures, write new drivers, or to understand the
subsystem internals.
