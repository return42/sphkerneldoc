The MTD project provides a couple of helpful tools to handle NAND Flash.

-  flasherase, flasheraseall: Erase and format FLASH partitions

-  nandwrite: write filesystem images to NAND FLASH

-  nanddump: dump the contents of a NAND FLASH partitions

These tools are aware of the NAND restrictions. Please use those tools
instead of complaining about errors which are caused by non NAND aware
access methods.
