Introduction
************

Welcome, gentle reader, to Rusty's Remarkably Unreliable Guide to Linux
Kernel Hacking. This document describes the common routines and general
requirements for kernel code: its goal is to serve as a primer for Linux
kernel development for experienced C programmers. I avoid implementation
details: that's what the code is for, and I ignore whole tracts of
useful routines.

Before you read this, please understand that I never wanted to write
this document, being grossly under-qualified, but I always wanted to
read it, and this was the only way. I hope it will grow into a
compendium of best practice, common starting points and random
information.
