.. _`mma_chip_info.members`:

Members
-------

chip_id
    WHO_AM_I register's value

channels
    struct iio_chan_spec matching the device's
    capabilities

num_channels
    number of channels

mma_scales
    scale factors for converting register values
    to m/s^2; 3 modes: 2g, 4g, 8g; 2 integers
    per mode: m/s^2 and micro m/s^2

ev_cfg
    event config register address

ev_cfg_ele
    latch bit in event config register

ev_cfg_chan_shift
    number of the bit to enable events in X
    direction; in event config register

ev_src
    event source register address

ev_src_xe
    bit in event source register that indicates
    an event in X direction

ev_src_ye
    bit in event source register that indicates
    an event in Y direction

ev_src_ze
    bit in event source register that indicates
    an event in Z direction

ev_ths
    event threshold register address

ev_ths_mask
    mask for the threshold value

ev_count
    event count (period) register address

.. _`mma_chip_info.description`:

Description
-----------

Since not all chips supported by the driver support comparing high pass
filtered data for events (interrupts), different interrupt sources are
used for different chips and the relevant registers are included here.
