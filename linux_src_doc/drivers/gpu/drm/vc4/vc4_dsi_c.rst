VC4 DSI0/DSI1 module
====================

BCM2835 contains two DSI modules, DSI0 and DSI1.  DSI0 is a
single-lane DSI controller, while DSI1 is a more modern 4-lane DSI
controller.

Most Raspberry Pi boards expose DSI1 as their "DISPLAY" connector,
while the compute module brings both DSI0 and DSI1 out.

This driver has been tested for DSI1 video-mode display only
currently, with most of the information necessary for DSI0
hopefully present.

.. _`vc4_dsi_init_phy_clocks`:

vc4_dsi_init_phy_clocks
=======================

.. c:function:: int vc4_dsi_init_phy_clocks(struct vc4_dsi *dsi)

    Exposes clocks generated by the analog PHY that are consumed by CPRMAN (clk-bcm2835.c).
