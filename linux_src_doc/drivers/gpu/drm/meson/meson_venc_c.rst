Video Encoder
=============

VENC Handle the pixels encoding to the output formats.
We handle the following encodings :

- CVBS Encoding via the ENCI encoder and VDAC digital to analog converter
- TMDS/HDMI Encoding via ENCI_DIV and ENCP
- Setup of more clock rates for HDMI modes

What is missing :

- LCD Panel encoding via ENCL
- TV Panel encoding via ENCT

VENC paths :

The ENCI is designed for PAl or NTSC encoding and can go through the VDAC
directly for CVBS encoding or through the ENCI_DVI encoder for HDMI.
The ENCP is designed for Progressive encoding but can also generate
1080i interlaced pixels, and was initialy desined to encode pixels for
VDAC to output RGB ou YUV analog outputs.
It's output is only used through the ENCP_DVI encoder for HDMI.
The ENCL LVDS encoder is not implemented.

The ENCI and ENCP encoders needs specially defined parameters for each
supported mode and thus cannot be determined from standard video timings.

The ENCI end ENCP DVI encoders are more generic and can generate any timings
from the pixel data generated by ENCI or ENCP, so can use the standard video
timings are source for HW parameters.
