.. c:function:: void i8259_set_poll(int (*poll)(void))

    Override the i8259 polling function

        pointer to platform-specific polling function

.. _`i8259_set_poll.description`:

Description
-----------

Call this to override the generic i8259 polling function, which directly
accesses i8259 registers, with a platform specific one which may be faster
in cases where hardware provides a more optimal means of polling for an
interrupt.
