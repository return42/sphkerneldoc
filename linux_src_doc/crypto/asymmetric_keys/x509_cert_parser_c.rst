Description
-----------

Decode an ASN.1 universal time or generalised time field into a struct the
kernel can handle and check it for validity.  The time is decoded thus:

[RFC5280 ยง4.1.2.5]
CAs conforming to this profile MUST always encode certificate validity
dates through the year 2049 as UTCTime; certificate validity dates in
2050 or later MUST be encoded as GeneralizedTime.  Conforming
applications MUST be able to process validity dates that are encoded in
either UTCTime or GeneralizedTime.
