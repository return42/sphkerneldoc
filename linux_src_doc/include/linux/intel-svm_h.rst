intel_svm_bind_mm
=================

.. c:function:: int intel_svm_bind_mm(struct device *dev, int *pasid, int flags, struct svm_dev_ops *ops)

    Bind the current process to a PASID

    :param dev:
        Device to be granted acccess
    :type dev: struct device \*

    :param pasid:
        Address for allocated PASID
    :type pasid: int \*

    :param flags:
        Flags. Later for requesting supervisor mode, etc.
    :type flags: int

    :param ops:
        Callbacks to device driver
    :type ops: struct svm_dev_ops \*

.. _`intel_svm_bind_mm.description`:

Description
-----------

This function attempts to enable PASID support for the given device.
If the \ ``pasid``\  argument is non-%NULL, a PASID is allocated for access
to the MM of the current process.

By using a \ ``NULL``\  value for the \ ``pasid``\  argument, this function can
be used to simply validate that PASID support is available for the
given device â€” i.e. that it is behind an IOMMU which has the
requisite support, and is enabled.

Page faults are handled transparently by the IOMMU code, and there
should be no need for the device driver to be involved. If a page
fault cannot be handled (i.e. is an invalid address rather than
just needs paging in), then the page request will be completed by
the core IOMMU code with appropriate status, and the device itself
can then report the resulting fault to its driver via whatever
mechanism is appropriate.

Multiple calls from the same process may result in the same PASID
being re-used. A reference count is kept.

.. _`intel_svm_unbind_mm`:

intel_svm_unbind_mm
===================

.. c:function:: int intel_svm_unbind_mm(struct device *dev, int pasid)

    Unbind a specified PASID

    :param dev:
        Device for which PASID was allocated
    :type dev: struct device \*

    :param pasid:
        PASID value to be unbound
    :type pasid: int

.. _`intel_svm_unbind_mm.description`:

Description
-----------

This function allows a PASID to be retired when the device no
longer requires access to the address space of a given process.

If the use count for the PASID in question reaches zero, the
PASID is revoked and may no longer be used by hardware.

Device drivers are required to ensure that no access (including
page requests) is currently outstanding for the PASID in question,
before calling this function.

.. _`intel_svm_is_pasid_valid`:

intel_svm_is_pasid_valid
========================

.. c:function:: int intel_svm_is_pasid_valid(struct device *dev, int pasid)

    check if pasid is valid

    :param dev:
        Device for which PASID was allocated
    :type dev: struct device \*

    :param pasid:
        PASID value to be checked
    :type pasid: int

.. _`intel_svm_is_pasid_valid.description`:

Description
-----------

This function checks if the specified pasid is still valid. A
valid pasid means the backing mm is still having a valid user.
For kernel callers init_mm is always valid. for other mm, if mm->mm_users
is non-zero, it is valid.

returns -EINVAL if invalid pasid, 0 if pasid ref count is invalid
1 if pasid is valid.
