.. c:function:: int wm8994_mic_detect(struct snd_soc_codec *codec, struct snd_soc_jack *jack, int micbias)

    Enable microphone detection via the WM8994 IRQ

    :param struct snd_soc_codec \*codec:
        WM8994 codec

    :param struct snd_soc_jack \*jack:
        jack to report detection events on

    :param int micbias:
        microphone bias to detect on

Description
-----------

Enable microphone detection via IRQ on the WM8994.  If GPIOs are
being used to bring out signals to the processor then only platform
data configuration is needed for WM8994 and processor GPIOs should
be configured using \ :c:func:`snd_soc_jack_add_gpios`\  instead.

Configuration of detection levels is available via the micbias1_lvl
and micbias2_lvl platform data members.

    Enable microphone detection via the WM8958 IRQ

    :param struct snd_soc_codec \*codec:
        WM8958 codec

    :param struct snd_soc_jack \*jack:

.. _`wm8958_mic_detect.description`:

Description
-----------

Enable microphone detection functionality for the WM8958.  By
default simple detection which supports the detection of up to 6
buttons plus video and microphone functionality is supported.

The WM8958 has an advanced jack detection facility which is able to
support complex accessory detection, especially when used in
conjunction with external circuitry.  In order to provide maximum
flexiblity a callback is provided which allows a completely custom
detection algorithm.
