Description
-----------

Enable microphone detection via IRQ on the WM8994.  If GPIOs are
being used to bring out signals to the processor then only platform
data configuration is needed for WM8994 and processor GPIOs should
be configured using \ :c:func:`snd_soc_jack_add_gpios`\  instead.

Configuration of detection levels is available via the micbias1_lvl
and micbias2_lvl platform data members.

Description
-----------

Enable microphone detection functionality for the WM8958.  By
default simple detection which supports the detection of up to 6
buttons plus video and microphone functionality is supported.

The WM8958 has an advanced jack detection facility which is able to
support complex accessory detection, especially when used in
conjunction with external circuitry.  In order to provide maximum
flexiblity a callback is provided which allows a completely custom
detection algorithm.
