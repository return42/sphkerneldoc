Description
-----------

The WM8996 has advanced accessory detection support for headsets.
This function provides a default implementation which integrates
the majority of this functionality with minimal user configuration.

This will detect headset, headphone and short circuit button and
will also detect inverted microphone ground connections and update
the polarity of the connections.
