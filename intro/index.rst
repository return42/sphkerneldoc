                       Linux Kernel's documentation a POC
================================================================================

This *POC* demonstrate some *alternative* Linux-Kernel documentation concepts
:ref:`[ref] <concepts>`.  At this time, not all of this POC is a part of the
Linux kernel source tree. If you wan't to read more about reST, Sphinx and this
POC jump to:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   poc_sphkerneldoc/index

Mostly you want to jump directly into the kernel documentation build by this
POC.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   docs

Another application is to generate a full source code documentation directly
from the kernel sources (see :ref:`Concepts <concept-autodoc-sources>`).

* `Linux kernel source <linux_src_doc/index.html>`_

.. hint::

   Be aware all this is in an experimental state. Suggestions are welcome,
   use `issue tracker <https://github.com/return42/sphkerneldoc/issues>`__.
