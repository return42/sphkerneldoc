   intro page. About man page see :ref:`[ref] <concept-man-pages>`.


User-oriented documentation
---------------------------

The following manuals are written for *users* of the kernel — those who are
trying to get it to work optimally on a given system.

* `The Linux kernel user's and administrator's guide <books/admin-guide/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/admin-guide/pdf>`__, `man <books/admin-guide/man>`__)

Application-developer documentation
-----------------------------------

The user-space API manual gathers together documents describing aspects of
the kernel interface as seen by application developers.

* `The Linux kernel user-space API guide <books/userspace-api/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/userspace-api/pdf>`__, `man <books/userspace-api/man>`__)


Introduction to kernel development
----------------------------------

These manuals contain overall information about how to develop the kernel.
The kernel community is quite large, with thousands of developers
contributing over the course of a year.  As with any large community,
knowing how things are done will make the process of getting your changes
merged much easier.

* `Working with the kernel development community <books/process/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/process/pdf>`__, `man <books/process/man>`__)

* `Development tools for the kernel <books/dev-tools/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/dev-tools/pdf>`__, `man <books/dev-tools/man>`__)

* `How to write kernel documentation <books/doc-guide/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/doc-guide/pdf>`__, `man <books/doc-guide/man>`__)

* `Kernel Hacking Guides <books/kernel-hacking/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/kernel-hacking/pdf>`__, `man <books/kernel-hacking/man>`__)

The following is a part of this POC it is not, of "what" the kernel community
has unified / take it as a *prospect* ;-)

* `template book <books/template-book/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/template-book/pdf>`__, `man <books/template-book/man>`__)

Kernel API documentation
------------------------

These books get into the details of how specific kernel subsystems work
from the point of view of a kernel developer.  Much of the information here
is taken directly from the kernel source, with supplemental material added
as needed (or at least as we managed to add it — probably *not* all that is
needed).

* `The Linux driver implementer's API guide <books/driver-api/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/driver-api/pdf>`__, `man <books/driver-api/man>`__)

* `Core API Documentation <books/core-api/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/core-api/pdf>`__, `man <books/core-api/man>`__)

* FIXME: not yet `Linux Media Infrastructure API (linux-tv) <books/media/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/media/pdf>`__, `man <books/media/man>`__)

* `Linux Networking Documentation <books/networking/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/networking/pdf>`__, `man <books/networking/man>`__)

* `The Linux Input Documentation <books/input/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/input/pdf>`__, `man <books/input/man>`__)

* `Linux GPU Driver Developer's Guide <books/gpu/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/gpu/pdf>`__, `man <books/gpu/man>`__)

* `Security Documentation <books/security/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/security/pdf>`__, `man <books/security/man>`__)

* `Linux Sound Subsystem Documentation <books/sound/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/sound/pdf>`__, `man <books/sound/man>`__)

* `Linux Kernel Crypto API <books/crypto/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/crypto/pdf>`__, `man <books/crypto/man>`__)

* `Linux Filesystems API <books/filesystems/index.html>`_
  (`pdf <books/filesystems/pdf>`__, `man <books/filesystems/man>`__)


Architecture-specific documentation
-----------------------------------

These books provide programming details about architecture-specific
implementation.

* `SuperH Interfaces Guide <books/sh/index.html>`_
   (`pdf <books/sh/pdf>`__, `man <books/sh/man>`__)


Korean translations
-------------------

* FIXME: not yet `Korean translations <books/translations/ko_KR/index.html>`_
   (`pdf <books/translations/ko_KR/pdf>`__, `man <books/translations/ko_KR/man>`__)


Chinese translations
--------------------

* FIXME: not yet `Chinese translations <books/translations/zh_CN/index.html>`_
   (`pdf <books/translations/zh_CN/pdf>`__, `man <books/translations/zh_CN/man>`__)


Japanese translations
---------------------

* FIXME: not yet `Japanese translations <books/translations/ja_JP/index.html>`_
